# JavaScript Loose vs. Strict Equality with Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in JavaScript related to the use of loose equality (`==`) versus strict equality (`===`) when comparing values to `null`.  The difference becomes apparent when dealing with type coercion. 

## The Bug
The `foo` function uses strict equality (`===`), correctly identifying `null` values and returning `null` in all cases where either input is null. The `bar` function, on the other hand, uses loose equality (`==`). This leads to type coercion when one of the arguments is a number and the other is a string, resulting in string concatenation instead of numerical addition. 

## The Solution
The solution involves consistently using strict equality (`===`) to eliminate any unexpected type coercion. 

## How to run the code
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your preferred JavaScript environment.
3. Run the code to see the different outputs and understand the behavior of loose and strict equality.

This example highlights the importance of being mindful of type coercion and choosing the correct comparison operator for reliable code.
